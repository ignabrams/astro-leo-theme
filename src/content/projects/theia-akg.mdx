## What is Theia AKG?

In todayâ€™s data-driven landscape, organizations manage vast datasets that include images, spreadsheets, videos, files, etc. This data can come from many types of sources like databases or applications. Both of these aspects make it difficult to retrieve and analyze data especially when there is a lot of metadata related. <Notation type="underline" color="yellow">Theia AKG simplifies this complexity by providing an intuitive UI that allows users to extract relevant metadata from graph databases and analyze it whithout having to manually search the data in databases.</Notation>.

## How was it Built?

Theia AKG was built mostly with React. React is a popular JavaScript framework used to create websites or applications. The styling was done by using css and a React UI library called Ant Design. For the backend part, an instance of a Neo4J database was integrated. Neo4j is a native graph database management system (GDBMS) that stores and manages data as nodes and relationships, rather than in tables or documents, allowing for efficient traversal and analysis of complex, interconnected data.

## What did I participate in?

I had the privilege of collaborating with a group of college peers and the team from Illumination Works LLC to develop the user interface (UI) for Theia AKG. My role involved <Notation type="underline" color="yellow">designing and developing the UI components</Notation>. I also contributed to the <Notation type="underline" color="yellow">integration of an instance of a Neo4J graph database with the React application</Notation>.

## What did I learn?

Being part of this project allowed me to grow my coding skills, delegate tasks, and collaborate with professionals. I mainly learned about React, JavaScript, and Vite. With no previous knowledge from these technologies, it was very challenging to complete this project. However, it was nice to have a team of professionals to guide us throughout the project and teach us some of their skills. Overall, it was a great experience with a lot of learning and collaboration.
