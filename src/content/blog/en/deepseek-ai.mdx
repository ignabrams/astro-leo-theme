## **DeepSeek: The New Disruptor in the AI Landscape**

DeepSeek is a Chinese Artificial Intelligence (AI) startup founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng and headquartered in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. They just released their newest model called DeepSeek R1, and it took everyone by surprise. DeepSeek R1 stands out for a few key reasons: it handles complex reasoning exceptionally well, it's cost-effective, and unlike many other models, it's open source..

## **Why DeepSeek is Making Waves**

1. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Superior Reasoning Model:**</Notation> The model excels in problem-solving, providing detailed explanations and a "Chain of Thought" (CoT) reasonging method. This method allows it to break down problems into smaller steps and adjust answers throughout the process, making it great for solving mathematical problems, data analysis and programming. 
2. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Open Source:**</Notation> DeepSeek R1 is fully open-source allowing users to customize and adapt the model to their specific needs. Also, it fosters community-driven improvements and features.
3. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Affordable:**</Notation> DeepSeek R1 is more affordable and accesible than other models. One of the most apparent differences is that DeepSeek R1 is currently free to use via its web interface and can be run locally on compatible computers at no cost. Also, the API pricing is highly competitive, offering significant cost savings compared to other models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. For more details on API pricing visit DeepSeek's API docs: https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing#pricing-details. 
4. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Efficient Training at a Fraction of the Cost:**</Notation> DeepSeek R1 was trained with a budget of $5.6 million, a fraction of the cost of training other leading models. Its training process optimized data usage and leveraged reinforcement learning early in development, reducing reliance on expensive computational resources like high-end GPUs.
5. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Disrupting the Stock Market:**</Notation> The launch of DeepSeek AI sent shockwaves through the stock market. Reports indicate that the AI industry lost \$2 trillion dollars in market value, with even tech giant Nvidia seeing a \$500 billion drop in its stock price. This disruption underscores the competitive threat DeepSeek poses to other AI companies.
6. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Record-Breaking App Downloads:**</Notation> Currently the most downloaded app on both the App Store and Google Play.
