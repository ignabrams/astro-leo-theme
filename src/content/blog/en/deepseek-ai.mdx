## **Why DeepSeek is Making Waves**

1. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Affordable and Accessible:**</Notation> DeepSeek is being compared a lot to ChatGPT, but it's not just about benchmarks. DeepSeek is way more affordable and accesible than ChatGPT. One of the most apparent differences is that DeepSeek is currently free to use, while ChatGPT operates on a subscription-based model. Sure, you can use ChatGPT for free but with limited features and capabilities. ChatGPT's subscription starts at \$20 per month for Plus access, with its premium GPT-4.5 model costing around $200. For casual users, this price difference is substantial.

2. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Open Source:**</Notation> DeepSeek adopts an open-source approach, making its design and code publicly accessible. This openness creates several advantages:
		- It allows users to customize and adapt the AI to their specific needs.
		- It fosters community-driven improvements and features.
		- It potentially reduces ongoing development costs through distributed contributions.
2. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Superior Reasoning Model:**</Notation> The model excels in logic and decision-making tasks, providing detailed explanations and step-by-step reasoning. For industries requiring clarity—such as healthcare, legal, and education—this is a game-changer.
3. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**User-Friendly API Integration:**</Notation> One of the standout features of DeepSeek AI is its seamless API integration. The API is designed to be incredibly easy to use, and it’s compatible with the OpenAI API format. This means developers can switch to DeepSeek with minimal effort, simply by tweaking their existing configurations. The affordability of the API further adds to its appeal, making it accessible to startups and hobbyists alike.
4. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Efficient Training at a Fraction of the Cost:**</Notation> DeepSeek AI was trained for just $5 million, a fraction of the cost of training other leading models. Despite this, it has managed to surpass benchmarks set by some of its more expensive counterparts. This efficiency in training highlights the potential for high-quality AI models to be developed without requiring exorbitant budgets.
5. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Disrupting the Stock Market:**</Notation> The launch of DeepSeek AI sent shockwaves through the stock market. Reports indicate that the AI industry los 2 trillion dollars in market value, with even tech giant Nvidia seeing a $500 billion drop in its stock price. This disruption underscores the competitive threat DeepSeek poses to established players in the AI space.
6. <Notation type="underline" color="cyan">**Record-Breaking App Downloads:**</Notation> Currently the most downloaded app on both the Apple App Store and Google Play, DeepSeek AI’s ease of use and versatility have won over millions of users in its first week.
